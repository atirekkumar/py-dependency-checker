# How to run
1. First run the script as ```./script.sh``` to check from broken dependencies.
2. If there are any broken dependencies, fix them first before checking for installation of new package.
3. To check if a new package will cause dependency issues, run the script as: 
```
./script.sh <package-name>
```

# Possible bugs
Make sure you are running python3 (and associated pip) and not python2.
